# HIGH-RISER ROBOT 3D DESIGN

## Overview

The project focuses on designing a **Smart Glass Cleaning Robot** specifically aimed at high-rise buildings. This robot can efficiently and quickly clean dust and dirt from large glass panels, ensuring hygiene and reducing the risk to human cleaners. The robot is designed to be safe, autonomous, and suitable for commercial applications.

## Features
- **Efficient Cleaning**: The robot uses brushes and adjustable wipers to clean glass without leaving streaks.
- **Autonomous Operation**: Features AI and IoT integration for autonomous cleaning.
- **Safe Operation**: Eliminates the need for human cleaners, ensuring no human lives are at risk.
- **Versatile Application**: Suitable for skyscrapers, glass structures, and solar panels.

## Use Cases
1. **Skyscrapers**: Cleaning glass panels on multi-story buildings.
2. **Glass Structures**: Ideal for tall, flat glass structures.
3. **Solar Panels**: Cleans panels on rooftops and solar fields.
4. **Commercial Use**: Profitable design for business-oriented cleaning services.
5. **Safe Cleaning**: No human presence required during the cleaning process, ensuring safety.

## Dependencies
1. **Power Supply**: Requires continuous power supply via integrated wiring.
2. **Supervisor Monitoring**: Requires supervision to ensure safe and efficient operation.
3. **High-Quality Components**: Uses durable materials like aluminum for the exterior and reliable electrical parts.
4. **Control Unit**: Autonomous operation controlled by a CPU with AI & IoT features.

## Revenue Model
The prototype is service-oriented, aimed at generating revenue by offering efficient and safe glass cleaning for commercial businesses, particularly in urban settings where glass structures are common.

## How It Works
![Working Diagram](robotpic/working_diagram.jpg) <!-- Replace with the actual image name and path -->
1. **Detection**: A camera detects the area that needs to be cleaned.
2. **Vacuum Cleaning**: The vacuum component removes loose dust particles.
3. **Brushing**: Cleaning brushes scrub the glass surface with a cleaning solution.
4. **Wiping**: Adjustable wipers clean off excess liquid, avoiding scratches.
5. **Smart Wipers**: Wipers fold inside when not needed on dry surfaces to protect the glass.
